*g-loaded-clipboard.txt*  Easier access to *quoteplus*

INTRODUCTION                                    *g-loaded-clipboard*

Vim's default *quoteplus* register for accessing the system clipboard is
somewhat tedious, and there have been various approaches to make access easier:

  * CUA keybindings with, e.g. |mswin.vim|
  * |clipboard-unnamedplus| to make |quoteplus| the default register for yank,
    delete, change, and put commands
  * |<Leader>| mappings
  * |i_CTRL-R| followed by +
  * Solutions that insert system clipboard contents one character at a time,
    such as using Ctrl-Shift-v (perhaps with 'paste' enabled)

This plugin is in this reference class, and makes use of the prefix "g" as a
way to make access easier.
